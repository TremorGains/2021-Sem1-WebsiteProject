Aloha sun worshippers! Whether Hawaii is your idea of paradise, exotic Thailand, or beautiful Costa Rica we have a typeface that wants to take you there. This irregular display font is
sure to make the others look pale by comparison. Think "fun in the sun", island drinks, and sandy beaches the next time you'd like to inject a splash of the tropics. Tiki Tropic is loaded
with graphics like jumping dolphins, palm trees, and Tiki masks to quickly add some visuals to a text document. You can also quickly convert to vector outlines in Illustrator. Basic latin,
numbers, punctuation, European accents, and kerning are all included.

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user
license agreement. You can also visit www.sharkshock.net/license for more info. I also design custom fonts for businesses, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to leave me a 
PayPal donation you can use my email address above. Your generosity will be most appreciated!
